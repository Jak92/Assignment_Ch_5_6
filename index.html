        Where have I been? <br />
        Here are some images of when I traveled the world. These were my top three favorite places. The food was amazing! 
        </p>

        <!-- store the images you want to use in a folder called "images" - you will need to use an <img href=""/> tag to place them in your document  -->

    <h2 id="animals">Favorite Animals</h2>
    
        <p>
        I definitely consider myself a cat person. I love dogs too, but I get along better with cats. Here are 2 images of my favorite animals. 
        </p>

        <!-- change this to fit the animal you like and add at least ONE <figure> and <figcaption> to one of the images, as seen on page 120. You can use that EXACT syntax -->
        <figure>

            <img src="images/animals/1.jpg" alt="Dog" width="150" heigh="150" />
            <figcaption>A dog.</figcaption> <br />
        
            <img src="images/animals/2.jpg" alt="I want a cat one day." width="150" heigh="150" /> <br />
            <figcaption>I want a cat one day.</figcaption>
        
        </figure>

        Here is a picture of my favorite movie. If you click on it, it will take you to my About Me page. Why? Well... because why not? ;) <!-- wrap your <img> tag with an <a> tag like this: <a href=""> <img src="" alt=""> </a> -->
